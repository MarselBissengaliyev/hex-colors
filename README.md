# HEX - colors


## The JavaScript:

- DOM manipulation
- data structures functions.


## About this project:

<p>While working on this project, I learned how to use onclick to bind a function to a button. In this case, the function generates a random hex code and makes that color the background.</p>
<p>Learning about this topic was very useful because literally every modern web application uses buttons. I suspect that I will use the technique I learned over and over again.</p>
